### Summary
The cultural tourism in Indonesia is highly diverse. However, this diversity is not fully utilized. Many cultural destinations tend to be underdeveloped due to a lack of recognition, and only a few people have explored them.

Tourists often find it challenging to access information about these destinations, leading them to visit well-known attractions that are already familiar to many people, even globally. Meanwhile, lesser-known cultural destinations remain neglected.

Therefore, the development of an information system is needed to address this gap. With sufficient access and information, it will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the country's economy.
